ABOUT PROJECT
SayIt — Multilingual, Hands-Free AAC Communication App

SayIt is an AI-powered Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) web application designed to help people with speech and motor impairments communicate naturally, expressively, and independently.

The app combines multilingual text-to-speech, voice and tone customization, and hands-free head & facial gesture controls to make communication accessible to users who cannot easily speak or use their hands.

🌍 Why SayIt Matters

Many AAC tools are limited by:

Few supported languages

Lack of personalization

Heavy reliance on touch input

SayIt removes these barriers by enabling:

Communication in multiple languages (including Nigerian languages)

Personalized voices and tones

Head-movement and mouth-gesture navigation for hands-free use

This makes SayIt especially useful for people with conditions such as ALS, cerebral palsy, autism, stroke recovery, or temporary speech limitations.

✨ Key Features
🧠 Pre-Built Phrase Library

Quickly communicate using commonly used phrases and expressions

Reduces the need for typing from scratch

🌐 Multilingual Support

Speak in any language, including Nigerian and other global languages

Seamless switching between languages

🔊 Voice & Tone Customization

Change voice type

Select tone (calm, casual, polite, expressive, etc.)

Allows users to express how they feel, not just what they say

🤖 Hands-Free Head & Facial Controls

Move head up/down to navigate or scroll

Turn head left/right to switch selections

Open and close mouth to click or select buttons

This allows full interaction without touching the screen.

♿ Accessibility First

SayIt is built with accessibility at its core:

Hands-free navigation for users with limited motor control

Audio-based communication for non-verbal users

Language inclusivity for underserved communities
